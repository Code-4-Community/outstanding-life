## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Install Node version 17.3.0 (npm 8.3.0)

Clone this repo and enter the root directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code-4-Community/outstanding-life.git
cd outstanding-life
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

Start the development server. (warning: do _not_ use `npm start` that starts up the server in production mode)

```bash
npm run dev
```

The web app should be running on `localhost:3000`

## üß™ Tests

Our tests run on the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test          # runs all unit tests
npm run test:frontend # runs all *frontend* unit tests
npm run test:backend  # runs all *backend* unit tests

# E2E tests
# requires a running DB (warning: clears DB)
npm run test:e2e      # runs all E2E tests in headless mode
npm run test:cy       # opens the Cypress app to run E2E tests visually
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

There are 5 main folders in this project:

- pages
  - Covers all the pages in the website.
  - Each page has their own folder with an `index.tsx` file containing the source code for that page.
  - An `_app.tsx` file is also included which has the overall page structure as well as an `index.tsx` file for the initial landing page.
  - Contains `dev_reference.md` with useful tips on how to build our web components.
- prisma
  - There is an `schema.prisma` file which outlines the schema of our database in one place.
  - The migrations folder contains any updates to the schema that are made overtime.
  - The `prisma.ts` file connects Prisma to the application.
- lib
  - Frontend components
  - Helpers/DTOs for the API routes
- styles
  - Contains our global CSS files. Fonts, margins, colors, etc. are defined here.
  - A `theme.js` file contains our custom brand color scheme to use in our Chakra components.
- test
  - Unit tests
  - E2E tests
  - Integration tests

## Sessions

### `useSession()`

`useSession()` returns an object like this

Note: this is different from the default behavior (includes `privilegeLevel`)
If you want to add more information from the prisma schema, add to the callbacks in `/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": null,
    "email": "jessica.su0807@gmail.com",
    "image": null,
    "privilegeLevel": "BASIC"
  },
  "expires": "2022-03-31T01:53:23.176Z"
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

Various commands that may help in the development process:

| Command                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npx prisma studio`      | Runs Prisma studio                                           |
| `npx prisma migrate dev` | Allows you to run changes/db migrations in the Prisma schema |
| `npm run prepush:fix`    | Helps when CI tests are failing                              |

Troubleshooting Postgres Issues:

- Make sure your .env file is updated with your postgresql user and password
  - username often defaults to 'postgres' upon installation

- Make sure your postgres server is running and is in an environment that shares processes with your dev environment (e.g. using WSL for both)
  - `sudo service postgresql status`
  - `sudo service postgresql start` 

- If you are having trouble with psql authentication or need to reset a postgres user's password follow these guides

"tile": "Insert title here",
"description": "Insert description here",
"date": "Insert date here",
"time": "Insert time here",
"registerLink": "Insert link here"
}
```

If you want to add more events to the "Past Events" section, you can directly add events into the 
`pages\programs\past-programs.json` file!
